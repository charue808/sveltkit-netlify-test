The Birthday Angels Program originated in 1980 with the hope that a remembered
birthday would indulge every resident with a happy memory and introduce a personal
relationship between the women of the 2nd floor and the women of JWS. Today, we
carry on the tradition of the Birthday Angel by bringing a beautiful balloon, birthday card
and a big smile to the residents (both women and men) of the Kuakini Care Home on
their birthdays.
