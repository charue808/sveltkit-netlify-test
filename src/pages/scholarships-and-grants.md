The Japanese Women’s Society of Honolulu was founded in 1954 as an educational and service organization. The organization was merged with the Japanese Women’s Society Foundation to form the Japanese Women’s Society Foundation in 2006 and its mission and goals remain the same. Its mission is to promote education and quality services to the community by responding to the changing needs of the society. The JWSF’s goal of becoming “an acknowledged leader and trendsetter in the area of health and issues pertaining to aging” and its objective of rendering worthwhile services to the community have led the JWSF to annually award scholarships to enrolled graduate students in the fields of health care, social work, or the arts and sciences who are focused on gerontology/geriatrics.
