### History

The first Adopt-A-Mom was held in May 1996. Throughout the years, this special event held on the 3rd Sunday of May has become a valued friendship tea tradition. It acknowledges and values the contributions made by our aging population and extends our appreciation to them. Notable guests from the consulates, government, community and the reigning Cherry Blossom Court honor these women. Members prepare Japanese dishes, cultural groups entertain and adopted moms (and dads) share interesting stories about themselves.
