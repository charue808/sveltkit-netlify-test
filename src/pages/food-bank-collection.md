The Hawaii Foodbank is one of Community Serviceâ€™s newest program to help meet the needs of food insecure island residents. 

Each month at a board meeting, board members donate non-perishiable food items such as rice, saimin, vienna sausage, spam, soup and other canned goods.  As of January 2020, we delivered 321 pounds of food items.

JWSF members who wish to donate may contact community.services@jwsf.org and arrangements for pick up will be made.
