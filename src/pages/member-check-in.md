description: An opportunity for members to maintain and renew their community network
---

One of the goals that the late Cathy Iwai wanted to achieve as President (2017-2019) was to maintain and renew networking with JWSF members who are homebound and
unable to attend some or all of JWSF events. The program will open the opportunity for our members to be a friend calling to remind them of JWSF events, saving a seat, being
in each other’s company at JWSF events, or making a call once in a while to see how they’re doing.

For more information as to how to get involved with this program either as a Check-In Member or a JWSF Friend, email Community Service at community.services@jwsf.org.
